Description
This dataset containing traits of marine fish is based on fish taxa observed during international scientific bottom-trawl surveys 
regularly conducted in the Northeast Atlantic, Northwest Atlantic and the Northeast Pacific. These scientific surveys target primarily 
demersal (bottom-dwelling) fish species, but pelagic species are also regularly recorded. The overarching aim of this dataset was 
to collect information on ecological traits for as many fish taxa as possible and to find area-specific trait values in order to account 
for intraspecific variation in traits, especially for widely distributed species. We collected traits for species, genera and families. 
The majority of trait values were sourced from FishBase (Froese and Pauly, 2019), and have been supplemented with values from primary literature.
